fairly simple by itself.
<br>Tic-tac-toe originated from the ancient Roman Empire around the first century BCE,
and it was called<front style="color:skyblue">" Terni Lapilli"</front>(three pebbles at a time).<br>First print reference of the game appears in Britain with the name "Noughts and Crosses" (nought being an alternative word for zero) in 1864. 
<br>The name "tic-tac-toe" is renamed from "Noughts and Crosses" or, X's and O's,  in the 20th century USA.
<br>Today "Tic-tac-toe" is one of the first games to be played by children due to its fast setup and easy engagement.
