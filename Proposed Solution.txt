 <p><h2>3.Proposed Solution: </h2></p>
 <h3>3.1. Game Layout: </h3>
 <h4>3.1.1.Player & Board:  </h4>
 <br>

 <img align = "center", src="CrossBoard.png" width="220", height="229"> <br>
 
In this game, there is
a board with n x n squares. <br>In our game, it is 3 x 3 squares.<br>
<br>
The goal of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be one of the players to get three same
symbols in a row -<br> horizontally, vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid. 
<br>

<br>Our game can be played by two players.Two player are human and computer.Which means we can play:<br>
 (a) Human VS Computer(In our game) 
 <br>

<h4>3.1.2. Proposed Solution:</h4>
<br>A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games
use “X”and “O”. <br>If first player choose “X” then the second player have to
play with “O” and vice versa.<br><br>
A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (may be “X” or “O”)
and his aim is to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally
with two intensions:<br>
<br>
a) Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.<br>
b) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.
<br>
<br>In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the
game results a tie.<br>
Hence there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent
(human or computer) wins or it’s a tie. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
If any player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in the following
combinations then that player wins.<br>
 <br>The winning combinations are:<br>

 <br>a) 1, 2, 3   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   b) 4, 5, 6<br>
 <br>c) 7, 8, 9   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   d) 1, 4, 7<br>
 <br>e) 2, 5, 8   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   f) 3, 6, 9<br>
 <br>h) 1, 5, 9   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   i) 3, 5, 7<br>
